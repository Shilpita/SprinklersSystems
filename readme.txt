The Humming Bee Home Garden Sprinkler System is a simulation of an automated watering system for lawns/gardens. 
The system can be programmed to water the lawns/gardens at specified times and/or based on the current temperatures.
The Home Garden Sprinkler System consists of many sprinklers and temperature sensors installed in a lawn/garden. 
The home-owner interacts with the system through a control panel. The home owner uses the control panel to configure 
the system to schedule the sprinklers in a specific area to start at a specific time(s) on specific days(s) of 
the week. The system can also be configured to start when the day temperatures reach a certain limit.
